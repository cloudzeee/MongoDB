MongoDb is a documented oriented NoSql database for storing high volume data
They are horizontally distributed and you can keep adding data. MongodB also stored data in doument(in json format)
It is a flexible schema(basically accepts any form or type of data)
It can handle unstructured data
basic difference betw the sql
MongoDB-No schema  SQL- Rigid schema
No joins        -     there are joins
denomralized data - Normalized data and there are so many relationships; hence the reason for join
fetching operation is fast - fecthing is slow
In Mongo DB - Maximu document size - 16mb
maximum nesting9having a database in another database) - 100levels
DB name - limited to 64

You can create a cluster in the cloud
Go to mongodb.com
signup and verify account
create free cluster and choose any cloud provider

To connect to newly created cluster
-load dataset
create database user by going to database access
whitelist/app Ip address by going to Network acces and add current IP
Then you can connect to your mongodb cluster
there are 3 ways to connect to a cluster -Mongo shell, using a mongodb compass, or through an application like nodejs

Using mongo DB shell
select the connect to mongodb using the shell option
select the OS and download mongobd zip file
unzip the file; go to the bin folder and copy the path
Open up this PC go to properties and then advanced systme prperties
under advanced click onEnvironment variables and then path
paste copied path into variable and save
copy connection string; Open up command prompt and enter

show dbs - shows all databases in the cluster
use 'database name' - similar to cd; helps you go into a directory
show collections - give all database collections
db.listingsAndReviews.findOne() - allows use read one of the documents in the collection


Also note once your cluster is created you wont be able to change the name.
should you have issues connecting to your cluster; check the IP


using insertOne() operation inserts one array of info e.g db.movies.insertOne({ id: "Aki and PawPaw", name: "A and P", year: 2009, genre["romantic","drama"], ratings:5, description: "new movie"})
insertMany() operation helps insert more than one documents
db.movies.find().pretty provides an arranged information about collections in movies database

MongoDb assigns a unique id to each added document. you cn also provide your ID else mongoDb provides a unique ID for your documents
